# Phaser Editor Vite TypeScript Template

This is a Phaser Editor v4 project template that uses Vite TypeScript for bundling. It supports hot-reloading for quick development workflow and includes scripts to generate production-ready builds.

It is a shell for an RPG I am building to learn Javascript at larger scopes.
