# JS_RPG2

### Created by: Greg Barker

## Project Overview

**JS_RPG2** is a learning project built using TypeScript, Phaser, and Vite. This project is part of my ongoing journey to deepen my understanding of game development and animation techniques, particularly focusing on sprite animations and the integration of physics within a 2D game environment.

## Story Premise

You arrive at **Shadowtide Island** after a long and fateful voyage at sea. As you explore the island's depths, you will uncover ancient, eldritch secrets—if you survive long enough. The island’s dark history will unfold before you, and in the end, you may discover what truly waits in the darkness.

## Features and Learning Goals

- **Sprite Animations**: Mastering the creation and implementation of sprite sheets for character animations.
- **Physics Integration**: Applying physics to game objects to enhance interactivity and realism.
- **Game Development**: Building a complete game loop with player controls, collisions, and scene transitions.
- **TypeScript**: Writing maintainable and scalable code with TypeScript.
- **Vite**: Utilizing Vite as the build tool for efficient development and quick iteration.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Phaser**: The primary game engine used for rendering and game mechanics.
- **TypeScript**: For strong typing and better code management.
- **Vite**: To streamline the development process with fast builds and hot module replacement.

## Future Development

JS_RPG2 will continue to evolve as I learn and incorporate new features and ideas. The aim is to create a compelling and immersive experience that challenges both my skills as a developer and the player's courage as they face the unspeakable horrors of Shadowtide Island.
