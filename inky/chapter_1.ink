// Scene 1: The Journey to Shadowtide Island

-> start
---

=== start ===
A small, lithe boy with pale, skinny arms climbed the aft-rigging of the Merchant vessel, the Emerald Fury. His shoulder-length black hair hung in his eyes, draped tightly over his head, and his clothes clung to his skin, wet from the remnants of the storm. His back was to the ceaseless motion of the vast ocean beyond, as he gazed up into the thinning clouds.

=== climbing_challenge ===
IMAGE: "The boy clinging to the slippery ropes, his knuckles white as he struggles to maintain his grip while the ship lurches with the waves."

The worst of the storm had passed, but the light drizzle still made the ropes slippery in his hands. It took more effort to hang on as the ship lunged in the waves. The ropes were obviously made for grown men with hands much larger than his. He wrapped his forearm around the ladder rope and held on tight, focusing on the crow's nest above.

* [Press on]
    -> approach_nest

=== approach_nest ===
IMAGE: "The boy's determined face as he narrows his eyes, looking up at the circular enclosure of the crow's nest where the rope ladder ends. A muscular calf dangles out of the hole in the platform above, attached to an old leather boot."

He gripped the ropes with white knuckles as the ship bobbed up and down, cresting each wave. Moving quickly and determinedly during the brief moments when the ship stood almost still, he looked up at the circular enclosure above and narrowed his eyes on the small hole in the floor of the nest, where the rope ladder ended. Dangling out of the hole in the platform was a long muscular calf attached to an old leather boot; his goal was nearly within reach.

* [Reach the crow's nest]
    -> enter_nest

=== enter_nest ===
IMAGE: "Obar, the ship's 'Sea and Sky Reader,' is slumped against the outer railing of the crow's nest, his cape pulled up over his head to block the rain. One arm is propped up on a keg of rum, while the other hand clutches an open flask of rum."

Obar was the ship's "Sea and Sky Reader," and this was his lookout, a circular platform crowned with a waist-high railing near the aft of the ship. The eager boy reached the top of the rope ladder, where multiple ropes converged at the entrance to the crow's nest. He popped his head up through the hole in the bottom, taking care to avoid the giant leg partially blocking his entrance.

* [Enter the nest]
    -> inside_nest

=== inside_nest ===
Sure enough, Obar was motionless, his cape pulled up over his head to block the rain, leaning against the outer railing with one arm propped up on a keg of rum. He was an unusually tall and elderly figure, somewhat gangly for a sailor, as his coordination was far from perfect. While he slumbered, his lanky body stretched out, one hand clutching an open flask of rum.

IMAGE: "The ship's mast rises through the middle of the navigator's nest, where it serves as the base of a small round table. Obar spends his evenings here, gazing at the stars and searching for clues about the ship's location."

The ship's mast came up into the middle of the navigator's nest, and at its peak, it multi-tasked as the base of a small round table. Obar would spend his evenings on calm nights, gazing at the stars, searching for clues about the ship's location.

* [Recall Obar's stories]
    -> obar_stories

=== obar_stories ===
IMAGE: "A flashback of Obar animatedly explaining navigation to the boy, pointing at maps and using strange binocular-like devices."

He claimed he always knew where the ship was, using the stars to guide its path. He sometimes acted like they actually spoke to him, thanking them for their helpfulness. The boy very much enjoyed the conversations he had with Obar. The grizzled veteran was probably the smartest person he had ever met. Unlike most adults, Obar was fun to be around. He seemed to come to life when you asked him anything about sailing, and he had a great laugh that made you laugh along with him.

* [Feel excited to be in the nest]
    -> take_in_view

=== take_in_view ===
IMAGE: "The boy sneaking the rest of the way up into the nest and standing to take in the view. From this high up, the world is differentâ€”endless ocean stretching to the horizon."

The officers had spent the last few days hiding from the rains, doing their drinking and planning indoors, leaving the sailors with the least seniority to tend to their duties. The boy's parents did not allow him to be up in the nest without the ship's navigator present, and he was more than excited to get back up there, where he could look down upon the ocean like a bird.

* [Experience the view]
    -> experience_view

=== experience_view ===
IMAGE: "The boy, standing in the crow's nest, gazes out at the vast ocean, the wind whipping through his hair as the ship sways with the waves."

He waited until he heard one of Obar's unique snore-whistle-coughs, then made his move, sneaking the rest of the way up and climbing to his feet to take in the view. From this high up, the world was different. He could see everything from one horizon to the next. It was a wonderful feeling, swaying with the waves, feeling the lurch of the ship, the wind at his back, and watching the clouds drift. It was like being pulled in every direction at once and coming back together again.

* [Observe Obar]
    -> obar_asleep

=== obar_asleep ===
IMAGE: "Obar, still snoring, rubs the drool from his bearded face with the back of his hand before going back to sleep."

The old navigator rubbed the drool from his bearded face with the back of his hand and then went back to his dream; probably involving the stars, the boy decided.

* [Look towards the forward lookout]
    -> forward_lookout

=== forward_lookout ===
IMAGE: "The forward lookout nest with another sailor on duty, scanning the horizon for land and signs of danger."

In the forward lookout nest, he could see another sailor on duty, eyes on the seas ahead, watching for land and signs of danger.

* [Think about the journey]
    -> long_journey

=== long_journey ===
Their journey had been over 30 days long now, and Obar had been keeping him informed of how far they'd traveled, pointing at maps and using straight edges and strange binocular-like devices to explain their course and speed. The boy didn't understand much, and who could blame him? His month of sailing experience aside, the boy had never traveled longer than a few days' ride in a carriage.

IMAGE: "A close-up of an ancient map showing the tiny, isolated Shadowtide Island as a small dot in the vast ocean."

One thing was clear to him: everyone expected to see land any day now. There were many dangers when sailing to the island, and one of them was missing it altogether. It was a lonely, isolated oval with a line going through one side on all the maps that Obar had shown him.

* [Consider the lookout's job]
    -> lookout_job

=== lookout_job ===
IMAGE: "The sailor in the forward lookout nest, scanning the horizon with intense focus."

He could see how it would be hard to find such a tiny dot in such a big place. He imagined the fellow at the front had a very important job, watching all day long for land, trying to make sure they didn't just float on past it.

* [Think about Obar as a lookout]
    -> obar_lookout

=== obar_lookout ===
IMAGE: "Obar, half asleep, half staring into the sky, illustrating how unsuited he is for a lookout job."

Obar could never be a lookout. When he was in his Navigator's Nest, half the time he stared up into the sky, and the other half, his eyes were closed. There were times when it was tough to tell if he was asleep, drunk, or thinking. This was not one of those times. Obar continued to snore as the boy crawled up to the railing of the nest.

* [Look out over the ocean]
    -> ocean_view

=== ocean_view ===
IMAGE: "The dark waters of the ocean stretch out before the boy, vast and seemingly endless. The ship lunges forward through the waves, with plumes of spray shooting into the air."

The dark waters of the ocean stretched out before him, vast and seemingly endless. Squatting in the crow's nest, high above the deck of the ship, the boy poked his head over the wooden railing. He watched in awe as the roiling waves slipped beneath the wooden hull of the merchant ship, its sails billowing in the salty sea breeze. The enormous vessel lunged forward and back, crashing through the oncoming waves, sending plumes of spray shooting into the air.

* [Feel the ship's motion]
    -> feel_motion

=== feel_motion ===
The boy held on tightly to the curved wooden rail. He felt the rain and wind whip through his hair, tugging at the wet strands with insistent fingers. He clutched tightly at one of the ropes running around the top of the railing, feeling the rough hemp bite into his palms. It was easier to hold onto than the slippery wood it was secured to, and he felt safe as long as he held on.

* [Observe the sailors below]
    -> sailors_below

=== sailors_below ===
IMAGE: "The sailors move about their tasks with practiced ease, their weathered faces creased with the effort of managing the ship's sails and rigging."

Below him, the sailors moved about their tasks with practiced ease, their weathered faces creased with the effort of managing the ship's sails and rigging. He watched them, his mind drifting off in the rhythm of their motions until he spied the Captain coming out of her cabin.

* [Duck down to avoid being seen]
    -> avoid_captain

=== avoid_captain ===
IMAGE: "The boy ducks down low into the crow's nest, hiding from the Captain, who is known for her short temper."

He ducked himself back down into the basket. He was fairly certain she had not seen him, but he ducked down low to make sure and bumped into Obar's other leg. The tall man shifted to one side and groaned, eyes still shut as he licked his chapped lips and swallowed hard, then relaxed again.

* [Recall what he knows about the Captain]
    -> captain_info

=== captain_info ===
IMAGE: "The Captain, a stern woman with a commanding presence, stands at the helm of the ship, her eyes scanning the horizon with intensity."

The Captain was known to be short-tempered, but the boy's family was quite wealthy, and his father had paid what he called "good money" for a safe voyage. More than once, in private with his mother, he overheard his father cursing the Captain and saying all kinds of surprising things about the Merchants Guild too.

* [Consider the Merchant's Guild]
    -> merchants_guild

=== merchants_guild ===
IMAGE: "An imposing building with the crest of the Merchant's Guild, symbolizing its power and influence over trade and travel."

The Captain was technically working for the Merchant's Guild, who had hired the Emerald Fury to ferry their goods. His family were not members of the guild, but the guild wanted his parents to join them. Specifically his mother.

* [Think about his parents' roles]
    -> parents_roles

=== parents_roles ===
IMAGE: "A flashback of the boy's father, a savvy merchant, standing in a bustling workshop, while his mother, an exceptionally skilled jeweler, crafts intricate designs."

His father was savvy with coin and turned his knowledge and his mother's natural gifts into what he called a "little empire of their own." Before the boy was even born, his father had built their workforce to over 100 men, groups of miners and prospectors mostly, and an equal number of men were employed now and then to transport and guard his shipments.

* [Reflect on his mother's secret role]
    -> mother_secret

=== mother_secret ===
Many admired his father, considering him a brilliant mind. He gained considerable renown for his craftsmanship in creating exquisite, high-end jewelry. The boy found it strange that his mother preferred to keep her role as the mastermind behind the company's finest designs and creations a secret. She never wanted credit for her work.

* [Recall her words]
    -> mother_words

=== mother_words ===
IMAGE: "A memory of the boy's mother in the workshop, her hands moving swiftly as she crafts jewelry, with a thoughtful expression on her face."

In fact, most of the time, she was apologetic when she finished a new necklace or ring. She always felt she and her own small crew of workers could do better. They were very busy all the time, and as his father hired more men to find the best minerals and rarest stones, his mother hired talented women to help her and learn her skills as best they could.

Mother: "It takes patience and a delicate hand that can also be firm like iron when needed... and men are only good at the last part."

* [Remember time spent with his mother]
    -> time_with_mother

=== time_with_mother ===
IMAGE: "The boy and his mother working together in the jewelry workshop, the boy watching intently as she works."

He frequently found himself in the workshop alongside his mother and her team of jewelers. He spent far more time there than with his father, who always assured him that someday he would be old enough to learn the "real" family business. He liked spending time in the shop, watching his mother work. Her hands moved with remarkable swiftness and certainty as she sculpted her designs, and when she cast them, she seemed to dance exuberantly throughout the workshop, to a song only she could hear.

* [Think about Shadowtide]
    -> shadowtide

=== shadowtide ===
IMAGE: "A ship loaded with supplies setting sail for Shadowtide Island, with the boy's father overseeing the preparations."

She was an extraordinarily talented jeweler, and the guild had extended them multiple invitations over the years to set up shop in Shadowtide. Not long ago, his father finally agreed. He sent a ship two weeks ahead of their own, filled with supplies and some of his best prospectors.

* [Recall his father's words about the island]
    -> fathers_words

=== fathers_words ===
The boy had heard his father talk about the island before, saying that the Guild doesn't know what they're talking about. There were rumors that there was a city there long ago that the earth had swallowed up. Miners were finding skeletons and refusing to work in a graveyard, their weapons and armor rusted so badly that they would fall apart when disturbed.

* [Feel a sense of excitement]
    -> excitement

=== excitement ===
IMAGE: "The boy, back in the crow's nest, wiping his face on his wet sleeve, with the wind whipping through his hair."

As he sat in the crow's nest, he wiped his face on his wet sleeve and brushed the hair out of his eyes. The boy couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation for what lay ahead. He had always been a curious and adventurous child, eager to explore and discover new places and rare things like his father.

* [Look out at the sailors]
    -> sailors_duties

=== sailors_duties ===
IMAGE: "The sailors, expertly managing the ship's sails and rigging, as the boy watches from the crow's nest."

And now, here he was, on a ship sailing to a mysterious island that was to be their new home. He crept back up to the edge of the nest, opposite the side where the Captain stood below. The boy watched as the sailors went about their duties, marveling at their skill and expertise.

* [Think about what he's learned]
    -> learned_knots

=== learned_knots ===
He had always been fascinated by the workings of ships, and he had spent countless hours of the trip watching and learning from the crew. He knew the names of all the rigging and the different types of sails, and he had even helped to hoist the enormous mainsail on occasion.

* [Recall learning knots]
    -> sailors_knots

=== sailors_knots ===
He grew more and more comfortable on the ship day by day. He had made friends with some of the sailors, and they had taught him how to tie a few knots. He was amazed at how many knots a sailor had to know. They seemed to all have their preference for which one to tie at which time, depending on the size of the rope and what the knot was for.

* [Reflect on time aboard the ship]
    -> time_aboard

=== time_aboard ===
The jewelers taught him how to tie a few knots, mostly for necklaces and bracelets, but these sailors really turned it into an art. He had also become more familiar with the routines and rhythms of life on board, waking early each day to help with the chores and spending his afternoons exploring the ship or reading in his cabin.

* [Notice strange occurrences]
    -> strange_occurrences

=== strange_occurrences ===
As the days had passed on their month-long journey, the boy began to notice strange occurrences on the ship. The sailors whispered of strange sightings and eerie sounds that seemed to come from the depths of the ocean surrounding the island.

IMAGE: "A dark, ominous sea with strange shadows beneath the waves, and ghostly shapes that could be cursed ships or sea monsters."

They spoke of cursed ships and sea monsters that preyed on unwary vessels, of jagged rocks that tore ships apart as the waves forced them to their doom, and of jellyfish that killed with one touch. Their stories left the boy feeling uneasy, and often at night, he would recall the tales before his mother tucked him into his hammock.

* [Recall his mother's reassurances]
    -> mother_reassures

=== mother_reassures ===
His mother told him they were just tales, but he could still see her worry. Both of his parents couldn't wait for the ship to reach port. At night when they thought he was asleep, they would talk and sometimes argue.

* [Recall his father's frustrations]
    -> fathers_frustrations

=== fathers_frustrations ===
IMAGE: "The boy's father pacing in his quarters, frustrated and cursing the Merchant's Guild."

His father cursed the Merchant's Guild for convincing him to ever leave, and his mother calmed him down. She seemed scared of the Guild and would often remind him of how far their reach went.

* [Reflect on the power of the Guild]
    -> guild_power

=== guild_power ===
IMAGE: "A fleet of powerful ships flying the Merchant's Guild flag, symbolizing their dominance over trade and the seas."

The Merchant's Guild stretched from one end of the land to the other, and their fleets ruled the oceans connecting all the port cities, shipping goods by sea, and having a hand in almost everything that traveled in and out of the major cities. All the nations had their own governments or ruling councils, but the King oversaw it all, and the Merchant's Guild was his right hand.

* [Imagine the fleet]
    -> fleet_imagination

=== fleet_imagination ===
He tried to imagine what hundreds of ships would look like, sailing together to find new lands, all just as impressive as the Fury, with its terrifying Captain.

* [Snap out of daydream]
    -> snap_out

=== snap_out ===
IMAGE: "The boy, startled, snaps out of his daydream as he hears his father's voice below, speaking with the Captain."

The thought made him shiver, and he snapped out of his daydream again when he heard his father's voice below. He scrambled over Obar's leg again and looked down to see his father and the Captain deep in conversation.

* [Listen in on the conversation]
    -> listen_in

=== listen_in ===
IMAGE: "The boy's father, standing with his hands on his hips, speaks with the Captain, who listens intently."

Father: "I don't like the sound of this. We've invested too much time and money into this venture to let it be derailed by superstition and fear. Every day we spend out here is another one wasted. I was told we would be there by now, and yet as I look around," he gestured in a wide circle pointing at the ocean around them, "unless I am missing something... we are quite behind schedule!" 

* [Observe the Captain's response]
    -> captain_response

=== captain_response ===
The Captain nodded.

Captain: "I understand your concerns, Mr. Lygosi, but you must understand that this island we are sailing for is not your average island. We need to be cautious and take our time approaching. One wrong move, and we'll be sunk, end up with the other fools who were in a hurry; at the bottom of the ocean. I won't risk my crew or my ship to save you a few coins. We'll get there when we get there," she paused and finished with, "Sir."

* [Hear the father's reply]
    -> fathers_reply

=== fathers_reply ===
IMAGE: "The boy's father, with a resigned look, sighs as he continues the conversation with the Captain."

Father: "It can't be as bad as your crew has been saying. The island is still nowhere in sight, and we're just crawling along. How dangerous are these rocks, really?"

Captain: "I assure you, Mr. Lygosi, you do not want to find out." 

* [Observe the Captain's gesture]
    -> captain_gesture

=== captain_gesture ===
IMAGE: "The Captain, arm around the boy's father's shoulder, points out into the distant waters ahead, speaking with a serious expression."

Captain Valeria gave up the helm to her first mate and walked over to stand next to the boy's father. She put her arm around his shoulder and pointed out into the distant waters ahead.

Captain: "I can see you're uncomfortable with our arrangement. Why don't you join us out here for a while. You've been locked up in your quarters for most of the trip. Have a drink with me. I've heard so much about you, I'd like to get to know the man himself."

* [Hear the father's response]
    -> fathers_response

=== fathers_response ===
Father: "Well, I appreciate the offer, Captain, really, I do. Although I adore the ocean like any other successful merchant, I have to admit that it has one downside for meâ€”being out here so long has left me feeling rather nauseous, and I highly doubt alcohol would soothe me."

* [Observe the Captain's reaction]
    -> captain_reaction

=== captain_reaction ===
IMAGE: "The Captain laughs heartily, slapping the boy's father on the back, and raising her flask in a toast."

Captain Katrina put her head back and laughed heartily, slapping Lavar on the back and pulling out her flask.

Captain: "Well, I hope you don't mind if the rest of us do!" She laughed again and held the flask up, then took a swig. "So, why Shadowtide?"

-> END
